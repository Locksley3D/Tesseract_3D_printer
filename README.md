Some notes for anyone trying to replicate this project. Every STL is sorted in the STL directory and anything that doesn't fit in any categories is in the useful prints section. Also while there is a BOM there might be some small things missing like screws and such, Also if you are using the BOM as a purchasing guide always get more of the little stuff like screws because there are screws for stuff like the electronics mount that are not in the BOM. If you do decide to build this printer I want to reiterate that this is a project and not a printer that will work right after building. I would be glad to answer any and all questions about thing printer which you can either leave here as an issue or as a comment on the YouTube videos that are linked below
